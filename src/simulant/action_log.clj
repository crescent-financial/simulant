(ns simulant.action-log
  "Library of helper functions for working with the Action Log
  service (defined in sim.clj). Use of this library is optional - it
  is intended to provide a useful layer on top of the base action log
  facilities in `simulant.sim`.

  In addition to the basic functionality provided by the action log,
  this library defines the concept of `steps`. A step is a grouping of
  entries in the action log, associated with execution of a particular
  action. For instance, if an `add item to shopping cart` action
  requires interaction with both the `item` and `cart` web services,
  the action log might contain entries for communication with both of
  those services, each of which could be tagged as a separate step
  involved in executing the overall action.

  In the case of things like multiple retries against a service, order
  of action log entires may matter. Therefore, action log entries
  logged via this library also include a sequence ID. Sequence ids
  imply a partial temporal order: all entries logged from a single
  thread will be tagged with monotonically increasing sequence IDs,
  but no guarantees are provided for action log entries recorded from
  two different threads. In the current implementation of simulant,
  actions for a single Simulant agent are executed sequentially,
  which, in the absence of use of threads within an action
  implementation, results in action log entries being tagged in
  chronological order."
